# Amazon Braket Workshops
This workshop explains how to use **Amazon Braket** service. From enabling the service to running the quantum algorithm, you can experience the all contents.
Thanks to the **Amazon Braket Sepcialist SA Team (Pavel & Tyler)**, you can run interesting quantum algorithm codes with various QPU devices including quantum annealers from **D-Wave**, and gate-based computers from **Rigetti** and **IonQ**.
